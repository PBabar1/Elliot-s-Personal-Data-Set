# Professional Tennis Serve Rankings
## Motivation
As someone who comes from a family of people who all play tennis, naturally I ended up playing tennis throughout highschool. I had the idea of Tennis statistics since I had never looked at sports statistics before, and I was curious what metrics they used to determine questions like: "Who is the best Server?"
## Data Process
I got my data from the ATP Tour Website (https://www.atptour.com/en/stats). Under the 'Serve Leaders' column, I downloaded the data and uploaded it into Excel. In terms of cleaning the data, I had to delete each of the players' pictures that came with their row in the data, and I had to change all of the columns that were talking about percentages, like "%1st Serve," from whole numbers with a percentage sign, to decimals, so that it would play nicer with Python. (Side note: This data changes frequently and the season is in progress, so rankings can shift quickly over time). 
## Visualization

This figure shows the Serving Statistics for the top 83 servers in Professional Men's tennis over the last year (Ranked from 1 to 83 from left to right). I decided after looking at levels of correlation, looking at these players' ranks relative to their percentage of points they win, when they start a point with their first serve. The big noticeable outliers, like Milos Raonic (Serve Rank #2). He has a high percentage of first serve points won, but his first serve accuracy is almost 10% lower than John Isner's (#1), and he has the second highest average double faults per match among the top 15 players. Generally the outliers we see here might be really good on this particular graph, but their overall serving rank suffers from other aspects.  

## Analysis
I wanted to look at how each of these top players' serving rank was related to what percentage of first serve points they had won. I chose this column because, while there were other columns that had a tighter spread of data points, for those ones it made less sense to do Regression with. In python, I plotted the two columns against each other as a scatterplot and used a Linear Regression fit for the data. While there are some outliers in this graph, those can be reasonably explained, and I think for real data this does a pretty good job. From this analysis, it is fair to say that a player's percentage of first serve games won can have a correlation with how high they are ranked for their serve.
