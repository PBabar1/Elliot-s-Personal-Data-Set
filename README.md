# Professional Tennis Serve Rankings

# Motivation
As someone who comes from a family of people who all play tennis, naturally I ended up playing tennis throughout highschool. I had the idea of Tennis statistics since I had never looked at sports statistics before, and I was curious what metrics they used to determine questions like: "Who is the best Server?"
