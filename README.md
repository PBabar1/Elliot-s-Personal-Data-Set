# Professional Tennis Serve Rankings
## Motivation
As someone who comes from a family of people who all play tennis, naturally I ended up playing tennis throughout highschool. I had the idea of Tennis statistics since I had never looked at sports statistics before, and I was curious what metrics they used to determine questions like: "Who is the best Server?"
## Data Process
I got my data from the ATP Tour Website (https://www.atptour.com/en/stats). Under the 'Serve Leaders' column, I downloaded the data and uploaded it into Excel. In terms of cleaning the data, I had to delete each of the players' pictures that came with their row in the data, and I had to change all of the columns that were talking about percentages, like "%1st Serve," from whole numbers with a percentage sign, to decimals, so that it would play nicer with Python.
